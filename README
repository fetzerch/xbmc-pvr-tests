xbmc-pvr-tests
==============

A prototype for automated system testing for the MythTV (cmyth)
XBMC PVR add-on using googletest and googlemock.

The goal of this suite is testing the full PVR add-on functionality
outside of XBMC, by triggering the PVR functions and comparing the results
with database queries or expectations on libXBMC calls.

Running in an environment outside of XBMC facilitates the use of valgrind to
check the implementation for example for memory problems.

Example: GetRecordings
 - Query all recordings from the MythTV database
 - Set expectation on libXBMC_PVR being called with the data from that query
 - Call GetRecordings
 - Check if the recordings from the database match the recordings received from
   the mythbackend (using MythProtocol)
